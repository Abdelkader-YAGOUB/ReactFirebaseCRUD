## React with Firebase CRUD Operations

This React project discusses how to implement React CRUD operations using Firebase.
To clear this topic, we created an app to manage contact information like - full name, mobile, email, and address.

First of all, go to Firebase Console, create firebase project. after that, you can create a database (using Database option from sidebar). then look for Real Database and click on create database. select the test mode to avoid permission for read and write operation.

After all, weâ€™ve to copy configuration data into react application. For that click on web icon in project overview (dashboard).

### Configure React App for Firebase

`npm i -s firebase`
